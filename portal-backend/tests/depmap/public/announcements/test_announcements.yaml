    We are excited to announce the launch of the Context Explorer, a brand new tool to discover selective gene dependencies and drug sensitivities, as well as see available data. The Context Explorer allows you to browse through lineages and primary disease types to investigate results for a context of your choosing. 

    In the scope of the Context Explorer, a selective vulnerability is one that shows up more strongly and/or more frequently in the selected context as compared to a defined “out-group”. Each vulnerability can also be clicked on to be viewed in greater detail, both in and outside of the selected context. 

    The Context Explorer can be connected to Data Explorer 2, and all results are downloadable. We are looking forward to hearing your feedback on this tool!
