      # now, since we are manually triggering this build, we really are sure we want a new version
      # but if we haven't make a commit that contains a conventional commit message for breadbox
      # (or more annoying: the bump job failed in the middle and we end up with a state where the
      # version failed to increment and we need to make a manual fake commit to force a build)
      # To avoid all that, automatically make a stubbed commit to force a version bump.
