    "term": "Predictive accuracy (r)",
    "definition": "Predictive accuracy (correlation between observed and predicted dependency) for the best model. Ensemble of random forest models using 5-fold stratified cross-validation to predict probability of dependency from 5 different subsets of omics features (unbiased, related). The unbiased model has access to all potential predictive features from RNAseq, ssGSEA, CN, damaging mutations (MutDam), missense mutations (MutMis), hotspot mutations (MutHot), fusion, proteomics, RPPA, metabolomics, RRBS, lineage context (Lin). The related model only has access to predictive features that are related to the target gene by inweb PPI network, paralogs by DNA sequence similarity, or members of the same CORUM protein complex."

    "term": "LRT",
    "definition": "Higher values indicate strongly selective gene effect distributions. Likelihood ratio test measures how much more likely the gene effect distribution is to be skewed-t compared to normal (null). LRT = 2*[ln(likelihood for Skewed-t) - ln(likelihood for Gaussian)]"

    "term": "Skewness",
    "definition": "Gene effect skewness. Negative value means the distribution of gene effects are skewed to the left, indicating the outlier cell lines are more depleted than the average cell line. Positive values indicate skew to the right (commonly observed for tumor suppressors). Calculated using the third central moment of the gene effect across all cell lines."
