            This dashboard will help you navigate the CRISPR drug anchor screens
            which have data analyzed and loaded into the portal.

              The ‚Äúvolcano‚Äù links will show a volcano plot of the differential
              dependency analysis produced by Chronos-compare. The x-axis shows
              difference in gene effect, negative values indicate greater
              dependency in the drug vs. control arm.
            </li>
            <li>
              The ‚Äúscatter‚Äù links will show a scatter plot of the drug vs the
              control arm gene effects.
            </li>
            <li>
              The table includes cumulative population doublings (CPD) for each
              screen arm; we have observed that there is little to no
              significant differential dependency when the gap in CPDs between
              the control and drug arm is less than 20% (% CPD change {">"}{" "}
              -20), presumably due to low drug effect.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: the gene effects shown in the scatter plot are from
            co-processing all screens with Chronos (ScreenGeneEffect), whereas
            the Chronos-compare volcano plots are from processing each anchor
            screen individually. As a result, the differential effect size in
            the volcano plot should be similar but not exactly the same as the
            difference shown in the scatter plot.
